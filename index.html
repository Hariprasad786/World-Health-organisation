				<h3>Safe Drinking Water In Europe</h3>
				<p>20 March 2018 – Millions of people in the WHO European Region drink contaminated water, often without knowing it. WHO estimates that, every day, 14 people die of diarrhoeal disease due to inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). Clean and safe drinking-water at home is frequently unavailable, particularly for those living in rural areas. In the Region, 57 million people do not have piped water at home, and 21 million people still lack access to basic drinking-water services.</p>

					<h3>Safe Drinking Water In Europe</h3>
					<p>19 March 2018 – WHO’s Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus concluded his first visit to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory. Dr Tedros saw the challenges that many people in Gaza face in accessing quality health services. For example, chronic electricity shortages in Gaza are hindering the delivery of life-saving medical services. In Israel, he recognized the progress made in the Israeli health system, such as introducing a digital health system, stronger food labeling laws, and extending free dental care to older people and children under 18.</p>

				<h3>India takes on malaria in its highest burden state</h3>

But the path towards elimination has proven a challenge in the eastern state of Odisha, which carries more than 40% of the country’s malaria burden. This photo story illustrates how in recent years, the state government has dramatically scaled up efforts to prevent, diagnose and treat malaria – with impressive results in a short span of time.</p>
